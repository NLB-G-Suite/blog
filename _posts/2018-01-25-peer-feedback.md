title: How to Give 360 Peer Feedback

Managers have a lot of practice giving people feedback. Most other engineers
are only asked to give formal peer feedback once or twice a year. These are
known as [360 reviews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/360-degree_feedback). From
a management perspective, the free text feedback portion is the most important
part. But, often the content in that section could be much more valuable with a
little more context.

## Make Sure You Have Context

If someone nominates you to give them feedback, they think you have
something to add. If you've worked with them on anything substantial, you probably
do have pertinent feedback, even if you have to spend time thinking about it.

If you really do not have enough experience working with someone, don't be
afraid to decline giving feedback. It will give the other party a chance to
find someone else. But in most cases, you should be spending the time to come up
with valuable feedback.

## Generating Feedback Ideas

Feedback has a half-life. It's most relevant right when you think of it - in the
moment. That's also when it's most effectively received. You should always try
to give people feedback as quickly as possible after the positive
or negative issue occurred. But, negative feedback should be given privately.

Managers already know it's a good idea to write down feedback as it comes.
It helps tremendously when reviews come around. This is good practice for anyone!
You can write down feedback in a shared document that you use for one on one notes.
It will help you remember specific examples later. More on that in a bit.

What else can you do to generate feedback? Here are some things that might jog
your memory.

- Email history to and from this person.
- Chat history.
- Code they have written, or code reviews they have done.
- Stories they have worked on.
- Documentation they have written.
- Retrospective notes.

## Be Specific, Give an Example, Cite Impact

Good feedback is specific and explains the impact. It contains a mix of positive
and negative feedback. It's been written in a thoughtful way. There are three
critical components:

1. Be **specific** - say *what* was good or bad about something they did.
2. Give at least one concrete **example**.
3. Explain the **impact**.

These rules go for both positive and negative feedback. The recipient will be
much more likely to internalize the feedback if you're specific, give an example
and explain the impact. It will also be much more actionable for their manager.

Don't be afraid to give it to the individual yourself. This is especially
true for positive feedback; it's very powerful for team health to call out praise
in a public setting. You could mention it in a team meeting, email, or via your
company's peer recognition program.

## Feedback Anti-Patterns

Often feedback is too generic. For example, "I like working with this person".
I call it *feel good feedback*. It's not specific. Giving an example and citing
the impact can transform your feedback into actual data.

Research has shown that you give the best feedback after getting to know someone,
but before forming a semi-permanent opinion of them. It turns out that the window
for the best feedback is [one to three years of exposure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/360-degree_feedback#cite_note-13).

If you've worked with someone for less time than that, or more, be aware of your own
biases. It might make sense to bow out of giving them feedback, especially if
you're trying to choose between too many requests.
