title: Sanitize HTML with Beautiful Soup
tags: xss plaintext beautifulsoup
---

<p>
If you have a website that displays user-generated HTML (emails, rich text entry, etc), you likely want to scrub that HTML before you display it. At the very least, you want to provide a reasonable protection against <a href="http://bitkickers.blogspot.com/2009/02/antisamy.html">XSS</a>. But maybe you also want to prevent the HTML from breaking your page layout. Either way, Beautiful Soup is a good tool for the job.
</p>

<p>
Here is some Python code that uses Beautiful Soup to clean HTML of any tags and attributes not explicitly white listed. The CSS property scrubbing is blacklist based, which sucks and should be redone with a real CSS parsing library. If you want a really diesel solution to this issue, I suggest you look at <a href="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_AntiSamy_Project">AntiSamy</a> for Java or .NET.
</p>

<p>
As a bonus, there is also a method for converting html to plaintext, while making a best effort to preserve the structural whitespace.

<i>Note: This method is neither fast, nor particularly bullet proof. You definitely want to cache the results so you're not performing this transformation while the user is waiting. Some documents will throw a HTMLParseError if Beautiful Soup cannot parse them. You can choose whether you want to do the secure thing and not show it at all, or if you want to risk it and show them the original HTML.</i>
