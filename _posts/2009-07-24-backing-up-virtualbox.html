title: Backing Up VirtualBox
tags: 
---

<p>
I've been playing with <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>, a great open-source virtual machine. Mostly I've been deploying Windows guests on a Linux host. Right now I have two VMs; one for IE8 testing, and one to run MS SQL Server.
</p>

<p>
I have noticed that VirtualBox can corrupt a VM image if it gets shut down unexpectedly. Given that it takes a significant amount of time to install an OS and get the tools you need running, I wanted to backup my VMs. 
</p>

<p>
I also wanted the backup to succeed even if the VM was running at the time. This is especially important for the SQL Server, as I'm running it as a service all the time. More on that in a future post...
</p>

<p>
Here is the script that I whipped up, aided by the excellent command-line tools that come with VirtualBox.
</p>

<pre name="code" class="ruby">
#!/bin/bash

# start by discarding all snapshots

#from `VBoxManage list vms |grep "^\(Name\|UUID\)"
VM=80e1cd84-0790-4c9f-a97e-97319c59431f

#from `VBoxManage list hdds |grep "^\(Location\|UUID\)"
HD=790acb86-703d-44e1-8f80-4e0229a2c054
VDI=WindowsXP.IE.vdi

# stop
VBoxManage controlvm $VM savestate

# backup (shrink happens automatically)
rm -f /home/chase/vms/backup/$VDI
VBoxManage clonehd $HD /home/chase/vms/backup/$VDI -remember
</pre>

<p>
<i>Note: You must discard all snapshots before running the backup. Otherwise, the backup will only get the pre-snapshot state.</i>
