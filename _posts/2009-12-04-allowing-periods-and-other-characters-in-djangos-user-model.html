title: Allowing periods (and other characters) in Django's user model
tags: django

<p>
By default, Django's authentication middleware only allows user names with 30 characters or fewer, containing only letters, digits and underscores. What if you want to allow other user names? It's actually a very small change to admin.py:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="python">
username_regex_field = forms.RegexField (
        label = "Username", 
        max_length = 30,
        regex = r"^[\w'\.\-@]+$",
        help_text = "Required. 30 characters or fewer. Letters, apostrophes, periods, hyphens and at signs.",
        error_message = "This value must contain only letters, apostrophes, periods, hyphens and at signs."
        )

class UserCreationForm(UserCreationForm):
    username = username_regex_field
    
class UserChangeForm(UserChangeForm):
    username = username_regex_field
    
class UserProfileAdmin(UserAdmin):
    form = UserChangeForm
    add_form = UserCreationForm
</pre>

<p>
All I'm doing here is defining a new <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/forms/fields/#regexfield">RegexField</a>, and then over-writing the default create and change user forms for Django auth.
