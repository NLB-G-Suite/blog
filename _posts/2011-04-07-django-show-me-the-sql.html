<p>
This week, I noticed that there was a select query in our production system without a where clause, and it was running a lot. Tracking it down, I found the piece of code that was running the query, but I couldn't be sure that my fix was actually changing the SQL to what I wanted.
</p>

<p>
In Django, it's pretty easy to ask the framework for the SQL in question. You can use the <a href="https://github.com/robhudson/django-debug-toolbar">Debug toolbar</a>, but in my case, this wasn't something that was running in a view. Instead, I used the interactive shell.
</p>

<pre name="code" class="python">
./manage.py shell
from django.db import connection
from myapp.models import MyModel
MyModel.objects.all()
&gt;[&lt;MyModel: 1&gt;, &lt;MyModel: 2&gt;, &lt;MyModel: 3&gt;, '...(remaining elements truncated)...']
print connection.queries
&gt;[{'time': '0.002', 'sql': 'SELECT "myapp_mymodel"."id", "myapp_mymodel"."field1", "myapp_mymodel"."field1" FROM "myapp_mymodel"'}]
</pre>

<p>
In my case, I was calling <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/querysets/#exists">.exists()</a> before getting the first element in the result set. Of course, the exists was returning all the items in the database! Instead, I just used a try/catch around MyModel.objects.all()[0].
