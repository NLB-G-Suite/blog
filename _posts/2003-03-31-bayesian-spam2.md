title: Bayesian Spam Filtering 2
---

The spam battle rages on...

I have a beta version of my new bayesian spam filter as outlined in Paul Graham's
Plan for Spam, called SpamNet. It's basically a statistical token-based text analysis web service.

You can play with the development version here.

I am currently working on a nice .Net Framework GUI for building the SQL backend from saved IMAP data files, and other niceties. When the whole thing is done, look for a version in my code section.
