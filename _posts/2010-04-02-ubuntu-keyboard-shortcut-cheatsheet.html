<p>
Everyone assumes that using keyboard shortcuts is more efficient than using the mouse. But by how much? One <a href="http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~lane/papers/hidden_costs.pdf">2005 study</a> found that keyboard shortcuts are approximately twice as fast.
</p>

<p>
So why don't more people use them? It's apparently not an experience issue. <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.117.3187&rep=rep1&type=pdf">A separate study</a> found that keyboard shortcut usage does not tend to increase over time, but rather correlates to social experiences. <i>People learn to use shortcuts from watching others.</i>
</p>

<p>
With that in mind, here is a cheat sheet of my personal most commonly used keyboard shortcuts. I'm not making any claims to exhaustiveness; in fact I intentionally left out commonly used but also commonly known shortcuts like "Alt + Tab".
</p>

<p>
I'm also not claiming that these are generally applicable. I'm a developer, so I included Eclipse, etc. Others are Linux specific, which automatically rules out 99% of users. Others require customisation to enable.
