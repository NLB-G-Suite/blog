title: getResource() resource patterns

<p>The Java <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/ClassLoader.html">class loader</a> contains a convenience method <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/ClassLoader.html#getResource(java.lang.String)">getResource()</a>, which is great for externalizing some static content from your code. In the past, I've used it almost exclusively with .properties files. Could there be a more ideal candidate for data that should be outside the code?</p>

<p>Recently, I wanted to leverage this concept to load text and html data. I needed to generate a email based on a static template. In order to support rich html email clients as well as plain text clients, it's necessary to send a MultiPart MIME email with both versions. My options were to hard-code the HTML/text templates in the Java code, or externalize them as files. I had a utility method lying around that would make this easy:</p>

<pre name="code" class="java">
    private static String txtTemplate, htmlTemplate;

    private static final String EMAIL_TEMPLATE_TXT = &quot;LegacyAppointmentEmail.txt&quot;;
    private static final String EMAIL_TEMPLATE_HTML = &quot;LegacyAppointmentEmail.html&quot;;
 
 static {
        try {
            txtTemplate = readFile(EMAIL_TEMPLATE_TXT);
            htmlTemplate = readFile(EMAIL_TEMPLATE_HTML);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            LOG.error(e);
        }
    }
 
    private static String readFile(String fileName) throws IOException {

        InputStream stream = LegacyAppointmentEmail.class.getResourceAsStream(fileName);
        BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(stream));
        StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();

        String line;
        while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null)
            builder.append(line).append(&quot;\n&quot;);

        reader.close();
        return builder.toString();        
    } 
</pre>

<p>My first unit test failed on the line where the first file was loaded. Initially, I thought the path must be wrong. I played with various combinations, such as moving the file to the root, putting the full scope into the file path, etc. Eventually, I went back and looked at some working code I had written in the past. The only difference I could see was that is was a .properties file, not a .txt file. I renamed the file, and it worked!</p>

<p>I knew that <a href="http://www.java2s.com/Code/Java/Development-Class/Loadresourcefilerelativetotheclasslocation.htm">wasn't right</a>, but I put it aside and continued on. When I came back to it, I tried to come up with the smallest reproducible case I could. I thought that if I was still stumped, at least I could post it on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow</a>.</p>

<pre name="code" class="java">
    public class Test {

        public static void main(String[] args) {

            assert Test.class.getResource(&quot;file.properties&quot;) != null;
            assert Test.class.getResource(&quot;file.txt&quot;) != null;
        }
    }
</pre>

<p><i>Note: file.properties and file.txt should both be blank files in the same directory as Test.java.</i></p>

<p>This test was still failing on the txt file, <b>in IntelliJ</b>. In order to get the cleanest repo possible, I saved Test.java to a new directory, and compiled and ran it from the command line using just the "javac" and "java" JDK command-line tools. Immediately, it started working.</p>

<p>Having isolated the issue to IntelliJ, I did a little digging. Even when I took all the classpath and "java" command arguments from IntelliJ and ran them manually, it still worked. Having eliminated runtime issues, I went into the IntelliJ compiler settings. The very first window shows the following option:</p>

<p><i>***Shakes fist at IntelliJ***</i> Oh well, it was a learning experience.</p>
