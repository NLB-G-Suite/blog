title: Python&#58; Convert a Word/PDF document to html
tags: django linux python

<p>
My current Django project deals with resume files in Word/PDF format. In order to show a web preview of the file, it's necessary to translate these files to plain HTML. While this was sometimes a pain in the past, I've recently found that it's relatively easy with standard Linux tools.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.abisource.com/">AbiWord</a> is a general purpose word processor for Linux. It has pretty good support for Word files, as well as many other formats such as PDF, RTF, etc. Usually it's invoked as a GUI app, just like Microsoft Word. However, being a Linux app, there is also good command-line support.
</p>

<p>
One of the things you can do from the command line is <a href="http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/intrepid/man1/abiword.1.html">convert files</a> from one format to another. Here is a quick example:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="bash">
# print the HTML translation of a DOC file to the console
abiword -t output.html resume.doc; cat output.html
</pre>

<p>
It's also relatively simple to invoke this from Python, using the standard libraries.
</p>

<pre name="code" class="python">
import subprocess
import os
import uuid

def document_to_html(file_path):
    tmp = "/tmp"
    guid = str(uuid.uuid1())
    # convert the file, using a temporary file w/ a random name
    command = "abiword -t %(tmp)s/%(guid)s.html %(file_path)s; cat %(tmp)s/%(guid)s.html" % locals()
    p = subprocess.Popen(command, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, shell=True, cwd=os.path.join(settings.PROJECT_DIR, "website/templates"))
    error = p.stderr.readlines()
    if error:
        raise Exception("".join(error))
    html = p.stdout.readlines()
    return "".join(html)
</pre>

<p>
AbiWord produces fairly clean HTML. If you want to scrub it even more, I would suggest something like <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">BeautifulSoup</a>.
