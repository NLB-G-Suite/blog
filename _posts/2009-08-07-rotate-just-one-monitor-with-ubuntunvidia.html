title: Rotate just one monitor with Ubuntu/Nvidia
tags: xorg ubuntu
---

<p>
I took some time this week to figure out how to rotate just my <a href="http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/monitors/2005FPW/En/about.htm#Front%20View">Dell 2005FPW</a> in an Ubuntu dual-monitor setup. The graphics card is an Nvidia GeForce 6200 LE, and I'm v180.44 of the proprietary binary drivers.
</p>

<p>
This gives you an idea of the setup I was going for, where the red monitor is the primary, and the blue monitor is the rotated secondary.

<p>
While I had been happily using Nvidia TwinView, I found that rotating just one of the monitors was impossible in this mode, due to the entire desktop being a single X screen. Instead, I switched to "Separate X screens", and then invoke the "Rotate" option on one of them.
</p>

<p>
I also had to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinerama">Xinerama</a>, which is an X extension that allows multiple X screens to operate as a single screen, allowing you to share windows, a task bar and a background between them.
</p>

<p>
Here is the xorg.conf file I ended up with. Most of it was generated from the Nvidia config tool, but then I tweaked it by hand a little.

<STYLE>
   .monitor0 {
      color: red;
   }
   .monitor1 {
      color: blue;
   }
</STYLE>

Voila! I can view web pages and edit code in 16:9 vertical, while doing everything else in 16:9 horizontal.
