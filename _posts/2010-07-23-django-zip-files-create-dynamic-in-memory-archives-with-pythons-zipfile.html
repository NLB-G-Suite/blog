title: Django zip files (create dynamic in-memory archives with Python's zipfile)

<p>
Usually, Django should not be used to serve static files.
</p>

<blockquote>
The reasoning here is that standard Web servers, such as Apache, lighttpd and Cherokee, are much more fine-tuned at serving static files than a Web application framework.

<p>
However, dynamic files are a different story. Say you want to wrap more than one file being generated on the fly from a form POST. In my case, I wanted to let the user download a zip archive of a few generated reports.
</p>

<p>
Using Python's <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/zipfile.html">zipfile</a> it's easy to create the archive in-memory, without writing to disk. Then, serving that file as a zip content-type is easy in Django.

<pre name="code" class="python">

from StringIO import StringIO
from zipfile import ZipFile
from django.http import HttpResponse

def download(request, company_id):     
    
    in_memory = StringIO()
    zip = ZipFile(in_memory, "a")
        
    zip.writestr("file1.txt", "some text contents")
    zip.writestr("file2.csv", "csv,data,here")
    
    # fix for Linux zip files read in Windows
    for file in zip.filelist:
        file.create_system = 0    
        
    zip.close()

    response = HttpResponse(mimetype="application/zip")
    response["Content-Disposition"] = "attachment; filename=two_files.zip"
    
    in_memory.seek(0)    
    response.write(in_memory.read())
    
    return response

</pre>
