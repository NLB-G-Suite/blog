title: Java replaceAll() File.separator

<p>
When dealing with file paths, it's not uncommon to construct a path where the file separators are missing or duplicated. Ie, instead of c:\temp\test.txt, you end up with c:\temp\\test.txt, etc. The real solution I suppose is to be meticulous about constructing the path, but in this case I found myself implementing a method to strip duplicate separators.
</p>

<p>
Using <a href="http://www.regexbuddy.com/">RegexBuddy</a>, I came up with a regex to match duplicate Windows and/or Unix file separators, unless they are at the start of the string. Ie, in Windows, \\server\share\file is a valid path, not a duplicate separator. My solution uses <a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/lookaround.html">negative look-behind</a>.
</p>

<pre name="code" class="java">
 protected static String stripRedundantSeparators(String path) {
  return path.replaceAll("(?&lt;!^)(\\\\|/){2,}", File.separator);
 }
</pre>

<p>
However, my unit test threw a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException. Messing around with it, I came up with the following working code.
</p>


<pre name="code" class="java">
 protected static String stripRedundantSeparators(String path) {
  return path.replaceAll("(?&lt;!^)(\\\\|/){2,}", "@").replace("@".charAt(0), File.separatorChar);
 }
</pre>

<p>
What I found was that File.separator was an invalid replacement string in the regular expression version or replaceAll(), but not in the regular string or char versions of replace(). Looking at the <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#replaceAll(java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String)">documentation for replaceAll()</a> revealed the problem.
</p>

<blockquote>Note that backslashes (\) and dollar signs ($) in the replacement string may cause the results to be different than if it were being treated as a literal replacement string; see Matcher.replaceAll. Use Matcher.quoteReplacement(java.lang.String) to suppress the special meaning of these characters, if desired. </blockquote>

<p>
Well, what a waste of 30 minutes. Here is the final code.
</p>

<pre name="code" class="java">
 protected static String stripRedundantSeparators(String path) {
  return path.replaceAll("(?&lt;!^)(\\\\|/){2,}", Matcher.quoteReplacement(File.separator));
 }
</pre>
