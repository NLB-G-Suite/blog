Many companies ask employees to write both self-reviews and 360 reviews of their coworkers at least
once a year. Especially for self-reviews, you should put a lot of time into coming up with specifics. For example, you might discuss
how quickly you were able to troubleshoot a production issue. You should try
to gather data and metrics as well. Make sure to specify what the
impact was in each case.

## Gathering Data

How do you gather data for your self-review? First, brainstorm all the projects
 you have worked on recently. You can look at old email, calendar items, task
tracking tickets, code changes, and Slack conversations. If you have a personal
growth plan, looking at your goals may jog your memory. You can also look at
your company's values and mission statement.

If this is your first performance cycle working with a new manager, it makes
sense to include the highlights of your historical accomplishments at the
company. He or she may not have gotten that full context from your previous manager.

The more number-based metrics you can gather, the better. It's totally worth
your time to write some lightweight code if you need to pull certain data. For
example, in the past I've spent a few hours coding solutions for [analyzing my calendar](https://github.com/chase-seibert/gcal-report), [my wiki contributions](https://github.com/chase-seibert/confluence-stats), and my
[code review comments](https://github.com/chase-seibert/github-org-stats).

## Writing

You always want your writing to be concise. Summarize the most important points
 at the top. Most content should be in bullet point form. Include all
 accomplishments, but organize them into categories. While your manager will
read the entire thing, it will help if it's scannable when you both sit down to
discuss it.

Most items should provide specific examples of accomplishments, and explicitly detail their impact on
 the team. It's not enough to say that you write very high-quality code. It's
much more actionable if you say you helped a teammate fix a specific bug in
 some code, resulting in system downtime being avoided.

It's worthwhile to try to phrase accomplishments in the same terms the company
 uses to evaluate people. Shamelessly use the exact words and phrases contained in the
review guidelines, mission statement, and company values.

Have a draft of your self-review ready for the last one-on-one with your manager
before it's due. It's fair game to talk about it in advance with your boss and
potentially change some items before you submit it. Your manager can help you
brainstorm additional accomplishments, examples, and impacts.

 Right after you have written your self-review is an excellent time to think
about updating your resume. Many of the accomplishments in your self-review, especially the
 data-oriented ones, are the exact things you should be adding to your public
-facing resume. People often forget their accomplishments when it comes time to
update their resumes for a job search. Gathering specific metrics and data points
contemporaneously with the work that you are doing is much easier than trying
to dig them up later.

## Going Forward

 A good manager should be drafting your review throughout the year, and you should
also be drafting your self-review on an ongoing basis! Take notes on your
 accomplishments throughout the year, and write down specific quotes you hear about
 your performance. Those are fair game to include in a self-review, even if the person quoted is not giving your 360 feedback. If the director of your department once
called you out in an all-hands meeting for doing a great job, include that in your self-review!

 How do you remember to write down your accomplishments over the course of
 a year? Try using a personal Google doc and set a weekly reminder on your
calendar. Each time, think about one or two things from the past week that you can document. When your self-review comes up, pick out the most impactful items.
As a bonus, you should also raise those accomplishments in real-time with your boss
during normal one-on-ones. Just like a manager giving feedback to an employee,
 it's more impactful to highlight these items as they happen.

## Wrapping Up

Don't be afraid to toot your own horn! While there is a place in your
 self-review to reflect on your weaknesses, the bulk of the review should
focus on what you're great at. During your day to day you optimize for team
 success. When writing your self-review, you want to call out what you
individually contributed to the team.

 Be aware that writing anything well takes time. You will need at least two or
 three drafts of your self-review. So, start at least a week ahead of when it's
due. That also gives you time to gather any relevant data that is not readily at your
fingertips even if it involves writing a little bit of code. Good luck!
