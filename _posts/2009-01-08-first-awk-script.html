<p>I have been aware of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awk">AWK</a> as a "general purpose programming language that is designed for processing text-based data" since college. But until today I never sat down to learn how to use it.</p>

<p>I had a log file that I needed to glean some information from, and turn into Excel spreadsheets with graphs. Here is what the text file looked like:</p>

<pre name="code">
127:  "Information","web-8","10/06/08","17:40:35","BHSTAFFING","Template RunScheduledTask2 has completed sucessfuly. 1 Messages(s) Sent - Execution Time: 0.24 (min)"
134:  "Information","web-10","10/06/08","17:45:31","BHSTAFFING","Template RunScheduledTask2 has completed sucessfuly. 5 Messages(s) Sent - Execution Time: 0.18 (min)"
137:  "Information","web-7","10/06/08","17:50:27","BHSTAFFING","Template RunScheduledTask2 has completed sucessfuly. 1 Messages(s) Sent - Execution Time: 0.12 (min)"
143:  "Information","web-10","10/06/08","17:55:29","BHSTAFFING","Template RunScheduledTask2 has completed sucessfuly. 4 Messages(s) Sent - Execution Time: 0.14 (min)"
146:  "Information","web-10","10/06/08","18:00:26","BHSTAFFING","Template RunScheduledTask2 has completed sucessfuly. 1 Messages(s) Sent - Execution Time: 0.09 (min)"
...
</pre>

<p>What I wanted was a comma delimited file with date, time and message count. With some trial and error, and a lot of help from the <a href="http://people.cs.uu.nl/piet/docs/nawk/nawk_toc.html">official AWK manual</a>, I was able to come up with the following command-line script:</p>

<pre name="code">
gawk "BEGIN { FS=\",\" }; {sub(/^.*\. /, \"\", $6); sub(/ .*/, \"\", $6); print $3 \",\" $4 \",\" $6}" input.txt  > output.txt
</pre>

<p>Viola! Nice clean CSV data. The code sets the column delimiter to a comma, replaces everything before the space and after the next space in column 6 (using a regex), and then prints out columns 3, 4 and 6 with commas between. This was using <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/">gawk</a>, an open-source GNU licensed implementation with a windows port.</p>

<pre name="code">
10/6/2008,16:10:54,5
10/6/2008,16:15:47,7
10/6/2008,16:20:51,7
10/6/2008,16:25:47,15
10/6/2008,16:30:51,5
</pre>

<p>Finally, the Excel graph in all it's glory:</p>
