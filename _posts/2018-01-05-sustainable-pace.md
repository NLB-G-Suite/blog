How do you make sure that your team is not signing up for too much?

There is no substitute for a well functioning team that has built trust
over time. When the product owner and
the technical lead have been through war together, they can
right size almost any project and prioritize it correctly. On new teams, how much work to sign up for can be a source of conflict. In that case, it's the technical lead's job to make sure the work load is realistic.

If you're having a planning conversation with the product owner, how should you
think about turning a "No, we can't do this" to a "Yes, and this is what we
can deliver and when"?

## Break into Milestones

Working sustainably is more about how much scope you are delivering per unit of time than it is about which things you are doing. Something that is 1,000 total man hours of work is fine if you're only delivering the 20 hour version this sprint.

Pick a work item and break it down into pieces. Can you simplify one of the pieces?
Can you postpone one of them? Can you agree to hack a solution for one piece for
the MVP and fill it in afterwards? Is one requirement accounting for a
disproportiuanate amount of the effort? Propose dropping it and see what people
say.

Set milestones up front. See how quickly you
can get to a working version. An early milestone does not have to satisfy
all the criteria. But it has to be working and shippable. If the team's priorities
shift, you can have a discussion about whether the last milestone is a good place
to leave the project for a while.

## Back to Scrum Basics

There is a reason why Agile principles are so widespread. They work.

- Stack rank the work items. Focus your energy on trying to cut items that are
the lowest priority for the product owner.
- Have a stable velocity. If your team has been running for a while, you
hopefully have predictable velocity and accurate estimates. In that case, it's
simple math as to how many stories you can do. Remember, you can
[estimate epics](http://chase-seibert.github.io/blog/2017/08/28/epic-story-estimation.html), too.
- Break stories into smaller pieces. If you can show that one piece accounts for
a lot of the work, maybe you can agree to do that work later.
- Agree to commit to less, but pull in additional stories if there is more time.
Again, textbook Agile.

For all these items, the Scrum Master is responsible for making sure the team is
living up to their own process. They should be the one to say whether the team
can commit to more work on not. This is one good reason for the Scrum Master to
NOT be one of the engineers on the team (or the product owner). There is a
perceived [conflict of interest](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/protecting-the-team-cuts-both-ways).

## Tie Breakers

If you still cannot decide between a too long list of work items, you might need
to invoke these roadmap planning judo moves.

*Note: no actual product owners were harmed in the making of this list.*

### The Outside the Box

Deprioritize work if there are significant issues with the design.
If there is similarly high priority work that has more solid design, it may make
sense to give this item more time to bake.

### The Big Picture

Deprioritize work if there are better technical solutions that the team can
pursue when they have more capacity in the future.

### The Deflection

Deprioritize work if there is another group that makes more sense to work on this item.

### The Disappearing Engineer

Deprioritize work if not every person-day of engineering you're assuming actually exists.
Does someone have a vacation coming up? Is there a project that you might need
to pull people off for? Are you accounting for interrupt driven work?

### The Consolidator

Deprioritize work if you have more work items than engineers. Consider having an engineer
focus on one task at a time. In many cases it would be better to go deeper on
high priority items in the backlog versus doing more discrete items.

### The Missing Link

Deprioritize work if there a dependency which is not already in production
and battle tested. It's risky to assume that two interdependent work items will
both land simultaneously.
