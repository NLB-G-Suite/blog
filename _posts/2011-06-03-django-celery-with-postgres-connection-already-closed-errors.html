title: django-celery with postgres&#58; "connection already closed" errors

<p>
I ran into a mysterious, transient exception this week using <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-celery">django-celery</a>.
</p>

<pre name="code" class="bash">
DatabaseError: server closed the connection unexpectedly
This probably means the server terminated abnormally
    before or while processing the request.
</pre>

<p>
At other times, I was seeing a slightly different error message.
</p>

<pre name="code" class="bash">
InterfaceError: connection already closed
</pre>

<p>
After some searching, I found <a href="https://github.com/ask/celery/issues/149">resolved issue #149</a> in the django-celery maintainer's github issues's list. It turns out that it's specifically a postgres issue, and only happens when the number of workers (the "c" parameter) is greater than one. Note: it defaults to the number of cores on your system.
</p>

<p>
A new <a href="https://github.com/ask/django-celery/issues/46">issue #46</a> has been opened, so this will likely get fixed. In the meantime, you can monkey patch the code to fix it yourself.
</p>

<pre name="code" class="bash">
sudo vim /usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/djcelery/loaders.py

    # inside DjangoLoader
    def on_task_init(self, task_id, task):
        self.close_database()
</pre>
