<p>
At work, I have a set of long-term goals I'm supposed to be making progress on over the year. As a way to remind myself about them, I have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron">cron job </a>setup to open the URL with the goals on them every morning.
</p>

<p>
First, you need to create a bash script to open a webpage. Note that I'm setting the display so that when cron runs the job behind the scenes, it knows which display to use. I'm also using <a href="http://portland.freedesktop.org/xdg-utils-1.0/xdg-open.html">xdg-open</a>, which will open a URL (or any document) in the currently registered application. In my case, that's Chrome.
</p>

<pre name="code" class="bash">
#!/bin/bash
export DISPLAY=:0
xdg-open https://docs.google.com/document/d/some_document_id
</pre>

<p>
I saved this as ~/bin/outcomes.sh. Next, you need to make it executable.
</p>

<pre name="code" class="bash">
chmod +x ~/bin/outcomes.sh
</pre>


<p>
Finally, you need to schedule it in cron. Here is the syntax for running it every morning at 8AM.
</p>

<pre name="code" class="bash">
&gt;crontab -e
* 8 * * * /home/chase/bin/outcomes.sh
</pre>
