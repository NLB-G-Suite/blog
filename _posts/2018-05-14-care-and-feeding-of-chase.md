During a recent job search, I introduced myself to many people, and had to
quickly communicate a sense of who I am, and how I manage a team. Maybe this
write-up will be useful as an introduction to team members in the future.

## About Me

I started coding in middle school and got into web stuff after Apple World 1996.
I did some freelance during college at Boston University, where I majored in
Computer Science. I went to a tiny startup called [Bullhorn](https://www.bullhorn.com/) after graduation. It
was a 10 person company that grew to 300+ by the time I left. I was hands-on,
doing everything from coding a custom email server to racking physical servers.

At the subsequent two companies, I focused on Python back-end work. I also
transitioned to be a full-time manager. I've found that managing people is the
way that I can have the most impact. Specifically, I can help promote healthy
relationships, excellent communication and high-leverage work on the team.

I love mentoring new engineers, and also first time managers. I geek out on
culture and process initiatives like hiring, promotion process, tech talks
and blogging.

Outside work, I enjoy basketball, ultimate frisbee, RPG video games,
photography, gardening, personal finance,
[reading science fiction](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9297327-chase-seibert)
and [cooking](https://www.dropbox.com/s/j16y65jm26780n8/cookbook.pdf?dl=0).

## Principles

My definition of high functioning individuals and teams tie back to these principles.

### Autonomy

Teams must be allowed to determine their own solutions, and set their own
priorities. There should be a clear line between the leadership that sets a
vision and explains the WHY, versus the team that determines the HOW. Teams
cannot be self-actualized without autonomy.

### Healthy Relationships

Inside the team, there should be a high level of trust, bred by radical
honesty. Part of building trust is demonstrating that what is said inside the
team will remain confidential. A team will grow best and maintain stability in
the face of change if it can be candid with itself.

### High-Leverage

As engineers, we often have a choice between solving a specific problem, or
solving the generic problem. That usually means more work. But part of the
unique leverage of software is re-usability. Whenever possible, teams should be
solving local problems AND helping the global organization solve related
problems.

## Management Philosophy

During my latest job search, I fielded the some of the same questions many times.
I thought it would be useful to document some of the most common ones.

### What are your expectations from your team?

- Hit your short-term sprint estimates nearly 100% of the time.
- Don't skip one on ones, come engaged with stuff to talk about.
- Identify a personal goal I can help you work on.
- Be excellent to each other.
- Bias to over-communicate in writing.

### What can you expect from me, as a manager?

- Weekly one on ones.
- Honest real-time feedback.
- Running a tight meeting.
- Autonomy to make your own technical decisions.
- Freedom to work your own hours, as long as your tasks get done.

### How do you manage people?

I try to set a strong vision for the team, and help them identify the lightest
necessary process. With that foundation in place, I've found that most teams
just need autonomy, healthy relationships and permission to invest in high
leverage work in order to be successful.

Tactically, I like to focus on healthy relationships by doing a lot of one on
ones, and leading retrospectives. I tend to over-delegate versus micro-manage.
I try to be a stabilizing force on the team, amping down in the face of chaos
or uncertainty, versus amping up.

### How do you hire people?

I like to evaluate candidates on communication skills, pragmatism and debugging
in addition to raw technical ability. I like people on the team who can generate
strong yes/no signals from their interviews. I value strong referrals.

### How would your team describe you?

Unflappable, practical, informal, disciplined.

### What is your biggest weaknesses?

I have a pretty poor memory. That's one of the reasons that I write so much.
It's also why I practice GTD.

### What are your biggest strengths?

Organization, process, attention to detail. I excel at being able to rally and
inspire a team.

### What's the most surprising thing you've learned about yourself?

I'm introverted, but I can get energy from spending time with people as long as
I know them well. I find that it takes six months to get comfortable with a new
team or business partner.

## What I need to be successful

- Weekly 1:1s with my boss, notes ahead of time on topics.
- Direct, unfiltered transparency on what's going on around/above the team from high level stakeholders.
- Direct, explicit feedback around “third rails” - things NOT to do/mess with. When to NOT push to clarify ambiguity.
- Meetings that start on time, stick to an agenda, and write ups with action items and notes.
- Projects with high priority that allow the team autonomy in finding a solution.
- Dedicated no meeting time in the mornings.

## What Motivates Me

I'm motivated by projects where I can:

- Collect evidence
- Set long term goals
- Refine a process iteratively
- Take my time to think things through
- Offer guidance to others

My super power is my ability to inspire and uplift people. I'm at at my best
when I can take charge and help everyone through a crisis.
