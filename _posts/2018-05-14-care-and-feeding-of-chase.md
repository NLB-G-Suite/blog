excerpt: "Part of my job is building working relationships, sometimes without
a lot of time. Maybe this will help."

I recently came across the concept of writing a [user guide](http://firstround.com/review/the-indispensable-document-for-the-modern-manager/)
for yourself. The idea is to bootstrap new people you're working with to give
them more upfront context about yourself.

As part of a recent job search, I had chance to be deliberate about how I communicate
my personal working style. I thought I would write those down, along with my results
in various standard personality tests.

## Background

I started coding in middle school, and got into web stuff after Apple World 1996.
I did some freelance during college at Boston University, where I majored in
Computer Science. I went to a tiny startup called Bullhorn after graduation. It
was a 10 person company that grew to 300+ by the time I left. I was hands on,
doing everything from coding a custom email server to racking physical servers.

At the subsequent two companies, I focused on Python back-end work. I also
transitioned to be a full time manager. I've found that managing people is the
way that I can have the most impact. Specifically, I can help create healthy
relationships, excellent communication and promote high-leverage work from the
team.

I love mentoring new engineers, and also first time managers. I geek out on
culture and process initiatives like hiring, promotion process, tech talks
and blogging.

## Principles

My definition of a high functioning individuals and teams tie back to these principles.

### Autonomy

Teams must be allowed to determine their own solutions, and set their own
priorities. There should be a clear line between the leadership that sets
vision and explains the WHY, versus the team that determines the HOW. Teams
cannot be self-actualized without autonomy.

### Healthy Relationships

Inside the team, there should be a high level of trust, breed by radical
honesty. Part of building trust is demonstrating that what is said inside the
team will remain confidential. A team will grow best and maintain stability in
the face of change if it can be candid with itself.

### High-Leverage

As engineers, we often have a choice between solving a specific problem, or
solving the generic problem. That usually means more work. But part of the
unique leverage of software is re-usability. Whenever possible, teams should be
solving local problems AND helping the global organization solve related
problems.

## Behavioral Questions

During my latest job search, I fielded the some of the same questions many times.
I thought it would be useful to document some of the most common ones.

### How do you manage people?

I try to set a strong vision for the team, and help them identify the lightest
necessary process. With that foundation in place, I've found that most teams
just need autonomy, healthy relationships and permission to invest in high
leverage work in order to be successful.

Tactically, I like to focus on healthy relationships by doing a lot of one on
ones, and leading retrospectives. I tend to over-delegate versus micro-manage.
I try to be a stabilizing force on the team, amping down in the face of chaos
or uncertainty, versus amping up.

### How do you hire people?

I like to evaluate candidates on communication skills, pragmatism and debugging
in addition to raw technical ability. I like people on the team who can generate
strong yes/no signals from their interviews. I value strong referrals.

### How would your team describe you?

Unflappable, practical, informal, disciplined.

### What is your biggest weaknesses?

I have a pretty poor memory. That's one of the reasons that I write so much.
It's also why I practice GTD.

### What are your biggest strengths?

Organization, process, attention to detail. I excel at being able to rally and
inspire a team.

### What's the most surprising thing you've learned about yourself?

I'm introverted, but I can get energy from spending time with people as long as
I know them well. I find that it takes six months to get comfortable with a new
team or business partner.

## Personality Tests

These were all encountered during various work trainings and team building
exercises. I've found that while not perfect, they can help a team build more
context quickly, IF the team is bought into it.

### MBTI - Type ISTJ

My Myers & Briggs personality inventory is `ISTJ`. This is a common personality
type known as [The Logistician](https://www.16personalities.com/istj-personality).

Some points that resonate with me:

- Integrity
- Focus on the practical
- Sense of duty
- No nonsense
- Decisiveness

The biggest impact I can have is when inspiring other peoples. To balance out
some of my natural tendencies, I need to tradeoff autonomy for depending
more on others, be careful to considers the feelings of others and be more
tolerant of people who are less process oriented.

### Strengths Finder

My top [Gallup Strengths Finder](https://www.gallupstrengthscenter.com) themes
are `Analytical`, `Focus`, `Discipline`, `Futuristic` and `Relator`.

Here are my high level take-aways.

| Theme | I find motivating | How I can be perceived |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Analytical | Collecting evidence | Shutting down extemporaneous discussion |
| Focus | Long term goals | Overly critical |
| Discipline | Repetitious process | Inflexible |
| Futuristic | Taking time to think | Can't think well on my feet |
| Relator | Offering guidance | Can’t work effectively with people I don’t know well |

### Enneagram - Type 8

My Enneagram type is [Type 8](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-8/).
These are the points that stand out to me.

At my best

- Self-confident, strong, and assertive.
- Use their strength to improve others' lives, becoming heroic, magnanimous, and inspiring.
- Your real power lies in your ability to inspire and uplift people. You are at your best when you take charge and help everyone through a crisis.

At my worst

- Ego-centric, domineering, confrontational and intimidating.
- Eights typically have problems with their tempers and with allowing themselves to be vulnerable.
- By believing that others are against you and reacting against them, you tend to alienate them and confirm your own fears.
- Eights typically overvalue power.

### Let's Work Together

This is a lesser known framework from [Sarah Dillard](http://www.ahumancapitalist.com/)
and the [SPD Advisory](http://www.spdadvisory.com/). I've found it to be useful
at communicating with coworkers how you can work together best.

| I value | We will be successful if |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Healthy relationships. Weekly 1:1s with boss, direct reports. Don’t skip. Know if an engineer is happy, what they need to stay happy, early warning if they are thinking of leaving. | Direct, explicit feedback around “third rails” - things NOT to do/mess with. When to NOT push to clarify ambiguity. |
| High leverage/reusable work. | Both parties are putting in 1:1 notes ahead of time so we can have super productive 1:1s. |
| Written communication. Wiki pages, blog posts, emails. Short, bullet point written communication. | Start meetings on time, stick to an agenda, write up action items/email notes.|
| Scrum process - estimating well, hitting 100% of what we signed up for during a sprint. | Highlight wins/learnings from the team with blog posts, internal talks/presentations.|
| Direct, unfiltered transparency on what’s going on around/above the team from high level stakeholders. | Looks for projects with high priority and allow for lots of autonomy in solving.  |
| Bias to action - if something is ambiguous I will come up with a plan and push for clarity. | We call out “blockers” well ahead of time, proactively identify issues where we need help. |
| Having dedicated no meeting time in the morning. | |
