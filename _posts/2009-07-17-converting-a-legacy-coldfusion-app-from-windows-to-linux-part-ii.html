title: Converting a legacy ColdFusion app from Windows to Linux&#58; Part II
tags:

<p>
For now, I've just decided to run ColdFusion under WINE. While I want to run it natively eventually, I don't want to undertake updating the code to use the correct case-sensitive file names. I'm sure my QA manager doesn't want me to undertake it just now, either.

Actually running it is dead simple:
</p>

<pre>
cd CFusionMX7/runtime/bin/
chmod +x jrun.exe
./jrun.exe -start coldfusion
</pre>

<p>
With WINE installed and jrun.exe marked as executable, everything just works. File case issues are handled by WINE. Performance is excellent; I don't notice any overhead subjectively. While I would not suggest this setup for production, it's adequate for development.
