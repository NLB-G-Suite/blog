<p>
Here are some quick recipes for getting information from varnish about top offending IP addresses, which pages those IP addresses are accessing, and which IPs are hitting particular pages.

<pre name="code" class="bash">
# top IP addresses
varnishtop -i TxHeader -I '^X-Forwarded-For:'
</pre>

<pre name="code" class="bash">
# which pages the IP address 66.249.68.228 is hitting
varnishncsa |grep 66.249.68.228 |awk '{print $7}'
</pre>

<pre name="code" class="bash">
# IP addresses hitting the /client-perf URL
varnishlog -m 'RxURL:/client-perf' |grep 'X-Forwarded-For'
</pre>
