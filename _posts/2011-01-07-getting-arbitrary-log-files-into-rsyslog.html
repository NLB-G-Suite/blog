<p>
Ideally, the applications that you're working with already supports the syslog standard. Failing that, it's often necessary to suck a regular text log file into rsyslog. Doing so is fairly easy, but I had a harder time than I suspected finding the documentation.
</p>

<p>
The key is the optional rsyslog module <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:sVAW5a8A9cEJ:www.rsyslog.com/doc/imfile.html+imfile&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us">imfile</a>. It's not enabled by default, so you will need to enable it.
</p>

<pre name="code" class="bash">
vim /etc/rsyslog.conf

# add the following
$ModLoad imfile
</pre>

<p>
You will also need to configure each log file you want to poll. If you want, you can place these settings in separate files under /etc/rsyslog.d. In this case, my application is called "celery".
</p>

<pre name="code" class="bash">
vim /etc/rsyslog.d/celery.conf

# add the following
$InputFileName /var/log/django/celery.log
$InputFileTag celery
$InputFileStateFile celery-file1
$InputFileSeverity info
$InputFileFacility local7
$InputRunFileMonitor
$InputFilePersistStateInterval 1000

# exit vim, and restart rsyslog
service rsyslog restart
</pre>

<p>
This will poll celery.log every 10 seconds, and echo the contents into syslog. You can then forward them to remote machines as necessary.
