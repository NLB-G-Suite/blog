So, you've given your notice at your job. Now what? First off, **stop coding**.
That's right. Finish whatever small task you're currently working on, but for
the love of god, stop writing more bugs. Of course, you want to get your manager's
sign-off on this, but in my experience managers generally accept that pumping out
just *one more feature* before you leave isn't the best use of your time.

So, what can you do to be useful?

# Write Documentation

Do you remember what documentation is? It's that thing that nobody ever produces.
You know, the stuff you wish you had when you started this job, and inherited a mess
of legacy code? (Every developer thinks that code they didn't write sucks.
The next guy is going to think you're code sucks. He's probably going to lobby to
re-write the whole damn thing.) Wouldn't it be nice if he had a road map to work with?

Never having written any documentation, some developers find themselves at a loss about
WHAT exactly they should be documenting. Maybe this will give you a starting point.

- Bookmarks
- Integrations with other systems
- Your new contact information
- How to create a new development environment from scratch
- How you deploy code
- Production redundancy configuration
- Schema migrations
- How to run any unit or automation tests
- How you typically debug the code, tools, etc
- Incident reports for past outages
- How the internationalization and localization happens
- Network diagrams
- A high level description of how all the pieces fit together
- Any reporting, especially random SQL scripts that are not in source control
- Any scheduled tasks that are running, expecially cron jobs not in source control
- How settings, entitlements and permissions work
- Anything you did that was "tricky"
