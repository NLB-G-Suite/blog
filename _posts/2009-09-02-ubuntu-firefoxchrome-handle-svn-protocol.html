<p>
If you're using using a web-based bug tracking system (in my case, <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/">JIRA</a>), or getting Subversion check-in emails in a web-based client, you may have seen URIs like this:
</p>

<pre>
svn://sourcecontrol:3690/MAINLINE/release_1.3/java/com/bitkickers/somefile.java#26981
</pre>

<p>
This is basically a link to your Subversion server, a particular file and a particular revision (26981). Wouldn't it be nice to be able to click on that link and have the diff open up? Firefox can be configured to handle the URI with a specific external application, but I could not find any such application for Ubuntu.
</p>

<p>
Enter the custom BASH script:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="bash">
#!/bin/bash

diff=meld
regex="(.*)(#|\?r=)([0-9]+)$"

urldecode(){
  echo -e "$(sed 'y/+/ /; s/%/\\x/g')"
}

urlDecoded=`echo "$1"| urldecode`

if [[ $urlDecoded =~ $regex ]]; then

        # the sed command is a quick and dirty URL decode
        url=${BASH_REMATCH[1]}
        revision=${BASH_REMATCH[3]}

        svn diff "$url" -c $revision --diff-cmd $diff

else
        echo "Can't parse svn URI"
fi
</pre>

<p>
This script parses out the revision number, calls the Subversion command-line tool to create a diff, and open the diff in <a href="http://Meld.sourceforge.net/">Meld</a>. Obviously, you need Subversion and Meld installed. Once saved as "svnhandler.sh", and made executable via "chmod +x svnhandler.sh", you can call it on the specific URI:
</p>

<pre>
./svnhandler.sh svn://sourcecontrol:3690/MAINLINE/release_1.3/java/com/bitkickers/somefile.java#26981
</pre>

<p>
You should end up with a Meld screen that looks like this:
</p>

<p>
To get Firefox to pass this URI to the BASH script, you need to open a new tab and go to "about:config". Then right-click in the grid, and select "New" to add the following two settings:
</p>

<ul>
   <li>String</li>
   <li>network.protocol-handler.app.svn</li>
   <li>/home/chase/bin/svnhandler.sh</li>
</ul>

<ul>
   <li>Boolean</li>
   <li>network.protocol-handler.external.svn</li>
   <li>true</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you search for "svn", you should see the following:
</p>

<p>
Now, that didn't quite work on its own for me. I had to go into Edit -> Preferences, Applications, filter for "svn", and then set the handler again there.

<p>
   <i>
      Edit: updated regex to support "svn://...?r=123" syntax as well.<BR>
   </i>
</p>

<p>
Edit: You can also add this script as the default URL handler in Gnome, which is also what Google Chrome will use to open the link.
</p>

<pre name="code" class="bash">
gconftool-2 -s /desktop/gnome/url-handlers/svn/command '/path/to/script/svnhandler.sh %s' --type String
gconftool-2 -s /desktop/gnome/url-handlers/svn/enabled --type Boolean true
</pre>
