<p>
Here are the basic steps to mount a Windows share under Linux:
</p>

<ol>

   <li>Create a file somewhere, perhaps in your home directory, to store the credentials. I called mine .smbcredentials</li>

   <li>Edit the new file and insert the following two lines:
      <pre>
      username=MyUsername@MyDomain
      password=MyPassword
      </pre>
   </li>

   <li>Make root the file owner
      <pre>
      sudo chown root .smbcredentials
      </pre>
   </li>

   <li>Allow root to read it
      <pre>
      sudo chmod 600 .smbcredentials
      </pre>
   </li>

   <li>Create the mount point
       <pre>
       sudo mkdir /mnt/backup
       </pre>
   </li>

   <li>Edit the mount config file
      <pre>
      sudo vim /etc/fstab
      </pre>
   </li>

   <li>Add the following line, replacing <b>backup</b> with your mount dir, <b>//offilefiles/backup</b> with your share, just like in Windows but with forward slashes, and credentials with your file location.:
         <pre>
         //officefiles/backup /mnt/backup smbfs credentials=/home/chase/.smbcredentials,uid=1000 0 0
         </pre>
   </li>

   <li>Reload fstab, at which point you should be able to list that mount directory.
      <pre>
      sudo mount -a
      </pre>
   </li>

</ol>

<i>Note: you may need to install samba first, with an apt-get install smbclient</i>
