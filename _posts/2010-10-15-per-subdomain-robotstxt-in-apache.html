title: per subdomain robots.txt in Apache

<p>
When I develop a website, I tend to go <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdomain">subdomain</a> crazy. If the site is crazy.net, I probably configure www.crazy.net, admin.crazy.net, static.crazy.net, youare.crazy.net, etc. Some allow concurrent logins as different users such as yourself, an admin account and maybe as a particular live user. Others are to keep your <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#cookie_free">static/media resources</a> cookie free, as well as allow parallel sockets for html/media content. 
</p>

<p>
In my typical use case, all of these subdomains point to the same Apache instance. So you can go to a particular relative URL at any of the subdomains, and you will get the same page. But I certainly don't want Google to index all those subdomains; I want a single canonical domain for the site. I'm hardly an expert in Apache configuration, so it took me an hour to track down the solution to this problem. 
</p>

<p>
Essentially, I wanted www.crazy.net to serve up a permissive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_exclusion_standard">robots.txt</a> file, as well as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_map">sitemap</a>.
</p>

<pre name="code" class="bash">
# robots.txt @ http://www.crazy.net/robots.txt
User-agent: *
Sitemap: http://www.crazy.net/sitemap.txt
</pre>

<p>
However, all subdomains should return a different, restrictive robots.txt for the same URL.
</p>

<pre name="code" class="bash">
# norobots.txt @ http://admin.crazy.net/robots.txt, http://static.crazy.net/robots.txt, etc
User-agent: *
Disallow: /
</pre>

<p>
Here is a sample of my /etc/apache2/sites-available/default config file that made this happen.
</p>

<pre name="code" class="bash">
ServerAdmin admin@example.com

ExpiresActive On
ExpiresByType text/css "access plus 12 years"
ExpiresByType application/javascript "access plus 12 years"
ExpiresByType image/png "access plus 12 years"
ExpiresByType image/gif "access plus 12 years"
ExpiresByType image/jpeg "access plus 12 years"
FileETag none

...

&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
 alias /robots.txt /home/apache/website/norobots.txt
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;

&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
 ServerName www.crazy.net
 alias /robots.txt /home/apache/website/robots.txt
 alias /sitemap.txt /home/apache/website/sitemap.txt
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Prior to this, all my directives were in a single VirtualHost. The key revelation on my part was that they don't need to be. Rather, Apache configs support inheritance from a global scope. So my VirtualHosts end up just being what's different between www.crazy.net and any other ServerName.
