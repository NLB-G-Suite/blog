<p>
I usually have several terminals open running various daemon processes in tabs. To make the tabs more identifiable, you can set the tab title from your BASH script as follows:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="ruby">
#!/bin/bash
printf '\033]2;%s\007' "You Title Goes Here"
#your daemon command goes here
</pre>
