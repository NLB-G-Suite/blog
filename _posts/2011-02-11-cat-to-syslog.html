<p>
Ever wanted to submit the results of regular command-line tools to syslog? <a href="http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/howto-linux-unix-write-to-syslog.html">Logger</a> lets you do that. Here is an example of logging CPU load and vmstat into to a centralized syslog server.

<pre name="code" class="bash">
cat /proc/loadavg |logger -p local7.info -t "load-cpu"
vmstat |tail -n +3 |logger -p local7.info -t "load-vmstat"
</pre>
