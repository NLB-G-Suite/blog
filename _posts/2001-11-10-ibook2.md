title: ibook2 + Linux
---

I just got my ibook2 up and running on OSX again after a brief run with ppc linux. Vim looks like it will never run in gui mode, so I'm stuck in 16 color cterm hell. The airport card is beautiful though, no problems and almost no configuration needed with a netgear me102 wireless hub. Next up: XFree86 on Darwin.
