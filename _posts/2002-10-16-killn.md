title: killn alias
---

I just took 20 minutes to scratch a 3 year old itch. Ever since I started programming in unix, I have wanted a kill command that can kill by process name, instead of just pid.

Behold, the one-liner:

```bash
kill -9 `ps|grep $1|awk '{print $1}'`
```

I tossed this into a fill named killn, did a `chmod +x killn` to make executable, and viola!

Now, you can run `killn project1` to kill all processes named project1, for example the 8 billion zombie process you left behind when you were fucking around with shared memory.

Toss another one-liner into your .cshrc file to include a new path in your run-time environment
``.cshrc <- setenv PATH {$PATH}:/home/ugrad/cseibert/sbin`.
