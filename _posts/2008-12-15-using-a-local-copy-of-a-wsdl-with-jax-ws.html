title: Using a local copy of a WSDL with JAX-WS
tags: jax-ws
---

<p>By default when JAX-WS auto-generates a proxy stub via wsimport, it will reference the live web version of the WSDL in the stub definition. This means that when the stub object is instantiated, JAX-WS will go over the wire to get a copy of the WSDL. Recently, we had a WAR deploy break because Spring was instantiating one of these on start up, and the actual third party WSDL wasn't there.</p>

<p>I little research turned up a <a href="https://jax-ws.dev.java.net/guide/Developing_client_application_with_locally_packaged_WSDL.html">few ways to make this WSDL a local resource</a>, instead. In our case, we just put it in the META-INF directory in the WAR, and made a small manual change to the stub code.</p>

<p>What used to be...</p>

        try {
            URL baseUrl;
