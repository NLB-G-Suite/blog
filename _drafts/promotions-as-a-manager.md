In advance
plan way in advance (previous review cycle)
figure out the exact process
talk to HR about indent to promote, how can you be most proactive?
get employee involved, go over architecture
ammunition analogy
identify endorsement targets - what do they need to see to be on board?
don't set expectations

Getting closer
identify endorsements, be explicit/make sure they are 100%
game plan for talking points
Get alignment with some other managers ahead of time
Have other individuals ready to support
Communicate that you intend to promote

Promotion discussion
Make a case to be there
Make sure you're clear on who should be in the room
Make sure you are clear on WHO and WHEN the actual decision will be made
Raise a question if the right people are not present
Highlight if the group is focusing on minor or too specific points

Afterwards
Follow up 1:1 for any objections
