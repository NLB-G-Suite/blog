This is intended as a guide for new product managers on my
team. It could also double as an introduction for people brand new to the
discipline. My views are inexorably colored by working as an engineer
exclusively on Agile teams at small companies.

## Basic Hygiene

From the perspective of the engineering team, these are the absolutely essential
functions of the product manager.

1. Be the domain expert. The team relies on the product manager to know the
business and to explain it a way that they can understand.
2. Prioritize work into an ordered backlog. Be aggressive about defining the
smallest scope so that the team can ship quickly.
3. Write detailed specifications and user stories.
4. Be present at team meetings and stand-ups religiously.

## Relationship Nexus

The product manager is the conduit between upper management, the consumer and
the execution team. Each group rarely interacts directly with the others.
In most situations, the product manager acts as a proxy for the other groups.
They need to build trust with each group, learn to speak each one's language,
and distill context in a different way for each of them.

The product manager is likely to have the best people skills of anyone on the
execution team. The best product managers I have worked with are also the
champion of team health.

The product manager has a special relationship with both the designer and the
engineering lead. The product/design/engineering leads should have a regular
sync where they talk about all the features that are in progress and coming up.

### One on Ones

The exact topics of your 1:1s will vary. The most important things are building
trust and repeating context so people internalize it. It can help to have a list
of [generic topics](/blog/2015/02/10/one-on-ones.html) to get conversations
started.

The minimum set of 1:1s looks something like this:

- Weekly 1:1s with the engineering lead and the designer.
- Weekly 1:1 with your boss.
- Semi-regular 1:1s with everyone on the execution team.

## Next Level

Both the product manager and the engineering manager have a responsibility to
protect the team from thrash. This is the [shit umbrella](https://roadmunk.com/blog/shit-umbrella/)
role - give the team the space they need to do the work.

Many teams do not have a dedicated QA person. In that case, the product manager
typically takes the role of identifying and documenting production bugs. Product
managers need to know how to write a great
[bug report](/blog/2016/02/26/QA-101-How-to-write-a-bug-report.html).

The very best product managers I have worked with have some level of technical
understanding of the implementation the team has created. It should be just
enough to sketch out how the product works at a high level. Otherwise, there
will be a mismatch between the [mental model](/blog/2016/04/15/mental-models.html)
of how it works, and how it actually works. Over time, that will result in
unexpected behavior and a poor user experience.

### Up-Leveling Technical Understanding

There is no magic bullet for this. One thing I would suggest is actually
white-boarding your take on system architecture with the engineering lead on a
regular basis. The product manager should drive. This will quickly highlight
gaps that you can dive into more detail on.

## Third Rails

There are handful of surefire ways to burn goodwill with engineers.

### Give an Estimate Without Buy-in

The product manager may feel pressured to say that something will be easy, or
commit informally to an estimate for a deliverable. This is always a mistake.
In the best case, their estimate is correct, but the team is unhappy. In most
cases, the estimate is dangerously off base.

### Commit to a Technical Decision Without Buy-in

The engineering team ultimately owns technical decisions, with the product
manager collaboratively involved. It's never OK to make a technical decision
without the team. Watch out for well-meaning non-technical stakeholders
dictating solutions. Those conversations should be redirected to clarify
requirements, and then the team should come up with the solution.

### Lack of alignment

The number one silent killer of projects is lack of alignment with upper
management. The product manager must be relentless about continuously
re-aligning on goals. Often, they are the only alignment touch point for the
team.
