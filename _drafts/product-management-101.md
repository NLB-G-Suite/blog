This is intended as a guide for new product managers on my
team. It could also double as an introduction for people brand new to the
discipline. My views are inexorably colored by working as an engineer
exclusively on Agile teams at small companies.

## Basic Hygiene

From the perspective of the engineering team, these are the absolutely essential
functions of the product manager.

1. Be the domain expert. The team relies on the product manager to know the
business and to explain it a way that they can understand.
2. Prioritize work into an ordered backlog. Be aggressive about defining the
smallest scope so that the team can ship quickly.
3. Write detailed specifications and user stories.
4. Be present at team meetings and stand-ups religiously.

## Relationship Nexus

The product manager is the conduit between upper management, the consumer and
the execution team. Each group rarely interacts directly with the others.
In most situations, the product manager acts as a proxy for the other groups.
They need to build trust with each group, learn to speak each one's language,
and distill context in a different way for each of them.

The product manager is likely to have the best people skills of anyone on the
execution team. The best product managers I have worked with are also the
champion of team health. They should have semi-regular 1:1s with everyone on the
team.

The product manager has a special relationship with both the designer and the
engineering lead. They should have weekly 1:1 syncs with both of them, and a regular
product/design/engineering lead sync where the three of them talk about all the
features that are in progress and coming up.

## Next Level

The very best product managers I have worked with have some level of technical
understanding of the implementation the team has created. It should be just
enough to sketch out how the product works at a high level. Otherwise, there
will be a mismatch between the [mental model](/blog/2016/04/15/mental-models.html)
of how it works, and how it actually works. Over time, that will result in
unexpected behavior and a poor user experience.

Both the product manager and the engineering manager have a responsibility to
protect the team from thrash. This is the [shit umbrella](https://roadmunk.com/blog/shit-umbrella/)
role - give the team the space they need to do the work.

Many teams do not have a dedicated QA person. In that case, the product manager
typically takes the role of identifying and documenting production bugs. Product
managers need to know how to write a great
[bug report](/blog/2016/02/26/QA-101-How-to-write-a-bug-report.html).

## Third Rails

There are handful of surefire ways to burn goodwill with engineers.

### Give an Estimate Without Buy-in

The product manager may feel pressured to say that something will be easy, or
commit informally to an estimate for a deliverable. This is always a mistake.
In the best case, their estimate is correct, but the team is unhappy. In most
cases, the estimate is dangerously off base.

### Commit to a Technical Decision Without Buy-in

The engineering team ultimately owns technical decisions, with the product
manager collaboratively involved. It's never OK to make a technical decision
without the team. Watch out for well-meaning non-technical stakeholders
dictating solutions. Those conversations should be redirected to clarify
requirements, and then the team should come up with the solution.

### Lack of alignment

The number one silent killer of projects is lack of alignment with upper
management. The product manager must be relentless about continuously
re-aligning on goals. Often, they are the only alignment touch point for the
team.
