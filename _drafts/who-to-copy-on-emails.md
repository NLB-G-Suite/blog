When to CC a boss
Can be a power play
Look for when people CC their boss back
Ask

If you have an ask, how will the other person feel? Maybe talk in person first.

Show a sensitive email to your boss first

Personal bias to CC fewer people, less political, less email spam, less noise.

- CC Lee on any email to Tapan
- Adding your boss+ to an email that has already started can be perceived as a power play, better to start out with the right recipients
- BCCing a boss is especially bad

Translate recipients into you and your direct reports
