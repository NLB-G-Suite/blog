excerpt: "I'm seen various personality and work style frameworks as part of
training and coaching sessions. Here is what I learned about myself."

I recently came across the concept of writing a [user guide](http://firstround.com/review/the-indispensable-document-for-the-modern-manager/)
for yourself. The idea is to bootstrap new people you're working with to give
them more upfront context about yourself.

I haven't written a full user guide, but I thought I would short-cut an initial
version by giving a read out on some standard working relationship frameworks
that I have evaluated myself against.

### MBTI - Type ISTJ

My Myers & Briggs personality inventory is `ISTJ`. This is a common personality
type known as [The Logistician](https://www.16personalities.com/istj-personality).

Some points that resonate with me:

- Integrity
- Focus on the practical
- Sense of duty
- No nonsense
- Decisiveness

The biggest impact I can have is when inspiring other peoples. To balance out
some of my natural tendencies, I need to tradeoff autonomy for depending
more on others, be careful to considers the feelings of others and be more
tolerant of people who are less process oriented.

### Strengths Finder

My top [Gallup Strengths Finder](https://www.gallupstrengthscenter.com) themes
are `Analytical`, `Focus`, `Discipline`, `Futuristic` and `Relator`.

Here are my high level take-aways.

| Theme | I find motivating | How I can be perceived |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Analytical | Collecting evidence | Shutting down extemporaneous discussion |
| Focus | Long term goals | Overly critical |
| Discipline | Repetitious process | Inflexible |
| Futuristic | Taking time to think | Can't think well on my feet |
| Relator | Offering guidance | Can’t work effectively with people I don’t know well |

### Enneagram - Type 8

My Enneagram type is [Type 8](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-8/).
These are the points that stand out to me.

At my best

- Self-confident, strong, and assertive.
- Use their strength to improve others' lives, becoming heroic, magnanimous, and inspiring.
- Your real power lies in your ability to inspire and uplift people. You are at your best when you take charge and help everyone through a crisis.

At my worst

- Ego-centric, domineering, confrontational and intimidating.
- Eights typically have problems with their tempers and with allowing themselves to be vulnerable.
- By believing that others are against you and reacting against them, you tend to alienate them and confirm your own fears.
- Eights typically overvalue power.

### Let's Work Together

This is a lesser known framework from [Sarah Dillard](http://www.ahumancapitalist.com/)
and the [SPD Advisory](http://www.spdadvisory.com/). I've found it to be useful
at communicating with coworkers how you can work together best.

| I value | We will be successful if |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Healthy relationships. Weekly 1:1s with boss, direct reports. Don’t skip. Know if an engineer is happy, what they need to stay happy, early warning if they are thinking of leaving. | Direct, explicit feedback around “third rails” - things NOT to do/mess with. When to NOT push to clarify ambiguity. |
| High leverage/reusable work. | Both parties are putting in 1:1 notes ahead of time so we can have super productive 1:1s. |
| Written communication. Wiki pages, blog posts, emails. Short, bullet point written communication. | Start meetings on time, stick to an agenda, write up action items/email notes.|
| Scrum process - estimating well, hitting 100% of what we signed up for during a sprint. | Highlight wins/learnings from the team with blog posts, internal talks/presentations.|
| Direct, unfiltered transparency on what’s going on around/above the team from high level stakeholders. | Looks for projects with high priority and allow for lots of autonomy in solving.  |
| Bias to action - if something is ambiguous I will come up with a plan and push for clarity. | We call out “blockers” well ahead of time, proactively identify issues where we need help. |
| Having dedicated IC time in the morning. | |
