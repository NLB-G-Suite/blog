title: Don't Split the Team Until You Have To

If you have a team that is unable to work effectively, there could be any
number of causes. Maybe you're thinking about splitting the team into two or
more teams as a way to solve the problem. My advice is to identify the root
cause of the problem, and fix that instead.

## Splitting the Team

Maybe you think that splitting the team will have one of the following
benefits.

### Team Too Big

The ideal Agile team size is 5-8 people. If you have more than that, you
are likely experiencing ineffective team communication, long stand-ups and
bottlenecks around the product owner and designer.

Splitting the team may actually put more strain on communication in the form
of cross team meetings and emails. Likewise, stand ups may be shorter, but
you may need to go to more than one. Splitting the team would also require an additional product owner the designer to relieve the bottleneck. Going without
either is not ideal. Neither is having someone splitting their time between
two teams.

A more direct solution would be to simple decrease the size of the team. Move
an engineer to another team.

### Too Many Products or Product Owners

If you have multiple products or product owners, you could split up the team
along those lines. This works, but keep in mind ideal Scrum team size. If you
only have one or two engineers on a team, you will be subject to wild swings
in team velocity when one or both people go on vacation, or are sick. You are
likely going to struggle to provide healthy levels of code review and mentorship
from engineers who have enough context on the work. Finally, you lose the ability
to flex resources and swarm everyone on one task if the need arrises.

Another solution would be to reduce the number of products the team is working
on, and funnel the product backlog through a single product owner.

### Prioritize Technical Work

I actually did split a team once in order to get more engineering time for
technical backlog work. Product owners are naturally going to prioritize
feature work, and we had a lot of platform debt to pay down. We ended up
doing a lot of platform work, but it was much harder than expected to keep the
two teams in sync. There was drift on alignment. A constant complaint was the
team not knowing what the other team was working on.

A better solution in this case would have been to come to an agreement to
reserve the time for platform work in the team's normal sprints.

### Empire Building

Maybe you have a technical lead who wants complete ownership of a certain
component. Maybe you have some who wants to to manage people, and you need a
team for them to manage. Or a manager who wants to manage multiple teams.
These are all terrible reasons to split up a team.

For technical projects, you need to find a way for people to have ownership
regardless of team makeup. For people interested in management, this is probably
a negative signal about whether they are a good fit for management. But just wait
a while, there will always be more organic opportunities for that.


## Other Stuff

Keep in mind that by splitting the team, you're creating a potential dependency
for future projects. Dependencies are productivity killers. Don't take that
too lightly.

## Final Word

You want to avoid splitting up a team until you absolutely have to. You should
prefer moving people to other teams versus splitting the team. Make sure you're
solving the root cause of your problems.
