### [One on Ones: how to have them effectively](/blog/2015/02/10/one-on-ones.html)
Getting good information out of your one on one conversations is something of an art. Given the amount of time over a career that you will spend during one on ones, it’s worth a small time investment to improve your skills.

### [Cross functional teams](/blog/2016/10/16/cross-functional-scrum-teams.html)
That means everyone regularly working in all parts of the stack. I’m not sure
this is better for all teams, but I think it’s a good idea for a small 3-5
person product team that has to do with in many parts of the stack.

<!-- ### [Delivery/Feature teams]() -->

<!-- ### [Culture: how to define and live it]() -->

### [Meetings: how to run one effectively](/blog/2017/03/31/meeting-best-practices.html)
If you are the owner of the meeting, it’s your responsibility to make sure that this is a great use of team time.

### [Communication: how to introduce change](/blog/2017/09/11/say-it-multiple-times.html)
To communicate something to an organization of people, you need to repeat yourself. The more people involved, the more you will need to repeat yourself if you want everyone to really hear it.

## Technical

### [REST API Design](/blog/2015/04/24/rest-api-design.html)
In spite of a simple definition, there is a wide degree of latitude when
designing a REST API to mess it up. Don’t do that!

### [Object Oriented Class Design](/blog/2014/12/22/class-design.html)
The concepts seem simple enough that it’s easy to fool yourself into thinking
that knowing the basics is equivalent to being an expert. The reality is that
most people could use a refresher on what makes a good object oriented abstraction.

### [Relational Database Design](/blog/2013/02/16/why-database-acid-matters.html)
For traditional RDBMS systems, it's important to re-emphasize the value of data
consistency.

## Python

### [Advanced Memory Leaks](/blog/2013/08/03/diagnosing-memory-leaks-python.html)
Long running Python jobs that consume a lot of memory while running may not return that memory to the operating system until the process actually terminates, even if everything is garbage collected properly. That was news to me, but it’s true.

### [Advanced Decorators](/blog/2013/12/17/python-decorator-optional-parameter.html)
Sometimes you want to pass parameters to your decorators. The trick here is to add another layer of indirection and create a function that takes parameters and returns your original decorator.
